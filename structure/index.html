						<h4>Charbel Bourjas</h4>
						<h5>EPIC Co-President</h5>
						<p>Since starting at Northwestern, I have had the opportunity to try many different projects to get a better
							sense of what my purpose is. Through my experiences at my internships, clubs, classes, and own side projects, I
							have discovered my passion for building products. EPIC contributed to that discovery immensely. I started my
							first business my freshmen year through Launch. Now, as a senior, my goal as EPIC President is to provide the
							same experience I had to the new members.</p>

						<div class='picture' style='background-image: url("../images/anna.jpg")'></div>
						<h4>Anna Feiler</h4>
						<h5>EPIC Co-President</h5>
						<p>Anna is a rising senior in SESP studying Learning and Organizational Change. She became involved in EPIC
							through its accelerator program, Launch, back when she was a freshman. At that time, it was a year-long
							accelerator. Even though she didn’t formally participate in the program, she attended the sessions and worked as
							the impromptu photographer on many occasions. After taking her first official LOC class as a sophomore, she
							began advising on the structure of Mission Control (the team that runs Launch). Through this advisory, she
							joined the team as a logistics manager and was asked to step up as a director of the program with her current
							co-president of EPIC, Charbel.
							<br />
							When she graduates in December 2018, Anna will be joining Deloitte’s Human Capital practice in Chicago (or
							selling-out, as some might say). She has hopes to return to NU in the next 5 years to pursue either an MBA or
							her Masters in LOC, and then find a startup or small firm that has values she can get behind.</p>

						<h4>Charlotte Emery</h4>
						<h5>Women in Tech Director</h5>
						<p>As a Polisci and Asian Studies major, I love history and politics. I also discovered over
							the course of a few tech and consulting-related internships in China and Hong Kong that I am really
							interested in tech, but especially in helping women succeed in the tech world. This discovery led
							Michelle (my co-founder) and me to found Women in Tech, which we run together as a branch of
							EPIC.
							<br />
							Women in Tech aims to help Northwestern women achieve professionally and personally in the tech
							world, whether that be with finding jobs and internships or developing the skills they need to succeed.
							We hold events that are designed to help women find out about opportunities in the tech world and
							how to pursue them, build both professional and personal skills, and to foster a sense of community
							on campus.</p>

						<h4>Ben Hool</h4>
						<h5>Sprout Director</h5>
						<p>By embracing entrepreneurial mindsets, we can discover innovative ideas to impact any business whether
							start-up or corporate. Experienced both in brewing up my own company and supporting the payment transactions of
							3.1 billion credit and debit cards globally, I joined EPIC to design an immersive program which aims to give
							Northwestern students the opportunity to learn entrepreneurship skills applicable to all career paths. Sprout is
							a start-up trek to the world’s innovation capital, the Silicon Valley, where twenty-five students embark on five
							days of intensive workshops, interactive site visits, alumni-entrepreneur panel events, and more.</p>

						<h4>Aishwarya Jois</h4>
						<h5>Launch Co-Director</h5>
						<p>I’ve wanted nothing but to be a lawyer since I was seven years old, so entrepreneurship was a… late discovery
							for me. My high school focused on the design thinking process for engineering, and in the process, I ended up
							stumbling into entrepreneurship and the idea that, yes, starting a company could be something I do, even while
							I’m still a student. That’s when I realized that that empowering discovery was one that I had to share with my
							friends and classmates - and exactly why I love Launch.</p>
					</div>

						<div class='picture' style='background-image: url("../images/samuel.jpg")'></div>
						<h4>Samuel Kim</h4>
						<h5>General Membership Director</h5>
						<p>As a student founder, I’ve been working on startups the majority of my life. Since the 7th grade, I’ve come up
							with business ideas, iterated, and sold products across several industries. Coming into Northwestern, I knew I
							wanted to be a part of the entrepreneurship company, so EPIC and The Garage were a perfect fit. I’m currently
							working on three companies, along with directing general admission for EPIC.
							<br />
							GM is geared toward bringing real-world entrepreneurial experiences to any student at Northwestern. Every so
							often, our team will hold events, whether they’re talks, panels, or workshops, and invite anyone who’s
							interested on campus.</p>

						<h4>Ashley Wei</h4>
						<h5>Operations Director</h5>
						<p>I joined EPIC in my freshman year spring because I thought it would be a
							new adventure for me, and it really is. As an econ and stats major, I&#39;m interested in
							business from an entrepreneurial perspective. Besides this, I&#39;m also more interested in
							the people and the operational work of this big community. And that&#39;s what the
							Operations team do. We help organize activities, facilitate events within EPIC and
							communicate with other internal and external teams. We do fun work with interesting
							people.</p>

						<h4>Barry Zhang</h4>
						<h5>Tech Co-Director</h5>
						<p>I’m a rising sophomore studying computer science and minoring in philosophy. I became involved with tech
							entrepreneurship early freshmen year when I joined Tech team of EPIC. Aside from EPIC, I’m also involved with
							the Northwestern entrepreneurship ecosystem through my data analysis work with the Farley Center of
							Entrepreneurship. I’ve worked as a web app developer in several student startups and I believe that technology
							is crucial for the conception, execution, and renewal of any entrepreneurial process. I hope to provide the
							tools and resources for my team members to gain insights into the tech entrepreneurship landscape.</p>
