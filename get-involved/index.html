						<div>
							<h4>Launch</h4>
							<p>Launch is a quarter-long student-led incubator program where you will learn everything from ideation to
								execution and turn napkin sketches into real, scalable businesses. Learn the ins and outs of an entrepreneurial
								mindset, then embark on an entrepreneurial journey (often for the first time) through an action-driven
								curriculum. Participants will form teams to start new companies that they build throughout the quarter,
								culminating in a Demo Day. In the last 2 years we’ve helped 100+ students start over 25 new companies; you
								could be next.</p>

							<h4>Sprout</h4>
							<p>We believe having an entrepreneurial mindset is important no matter what students do after college. That’s
								why we created the first program at Northwestern that gives students an immersive experience in the undeniable
								startup capital - the Silicon Valley.</p>

						<h2><span>Teams</span></h2>
						<div>
							<h4>Branding</h4>
							<p>Many local companies and start-ups at Northwestern/Evanston have great products made by talented teams.
								However, sometimes marketing those products can be difficult without the adequate help or marketing strategies.
								Thus, Branding comes into play in which we help enable those companies to accelerate their businesses based on
								their targeted audiences. As Branding, we will focus our work on two parts: one being the internal work of EPIC
								and the other focusing on external groups such as local businesses and start-ups. We want to utilize our
								member’s skill sets to make a definite impact on these businesses as if it was a real-world profession.</p>

							<h4>Operations</h4>
							<p>As one of the most important parts in EPIC’s internal affairs, Operations team strives to create a helpful,
								harmonious and friendly environment for EPIC. By organizing various social events and planning out workshops,
								we connects different departments together by giving them an opportunity to communicate and learn from each
								other. Operations dedicates itself to help EPIC grow as a complete whole.</p>

						</div>
						<div>
							<h4>Tech</h4>
							<p>Technology is crucial for the implementation of entrepreneurial endeavors. Tech aims to bring exposures and
								experiences to students through technical projects in the Northwestern ecosystem. Tech started out as an IT
								department for EPIC. We built EPIC’s first website and hosted servers for other teams within EPIC. Two years
								ago, we decided to invest in our own ideas and grow our members’ technical and entrepreneurial skills through
								personal projects. The projects were used as a training system for our members to learn new languages and
								tools. Last year, with those new skills, Tech took on the task of designing and implementing an application for
								Brew Bike. Currently, the members are on a new trajectory to work on Northwestern-focused projects that provide
								value for the Northwestern community.</p>

							<h4>Women in Tech</h4>
							<p>Women in Tech equips women on campus with the necessary skills and networks to become successful leaders in
								the world of tech, innovation, and entrepreneurship. We aim to leverage Northwestern’s connections to startups
								and prominent tech companies in order to provide career resources and opportunities for female students.</p>
